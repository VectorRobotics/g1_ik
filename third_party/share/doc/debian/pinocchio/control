Description: Efficient rigid body dynamics

 Pinocchio is a C++ library for dynamic computations focusing on robotic,
 computer animation and biomechanical applications. It is based on the dynamic
 multi-body computations formalized by Featherstone in his book.
 The software comes with a python wrapping and vizualisation tool, available
 separately in the py-pinocchio package.
 .
 The following algorithms are implemented.
  * Recursive Newton-Euler algorithm (RNEA, i.e inverse dynamics)
  * Composite Rigid Body algorithm (CRBA, i.e generalized inertia matrix)
  * Sparse Cholsky decomposition of the inertia matrix (for constrained
    forward-dynamics resolution)
  * Placement Jacobians (i.e application from configuration velocities to
    end-effector spatial velocities), along with computation of body placements,
    velocities and accelerations.
  * Center of mass and its Jacobian
 .
 The model can be parsed from a URDF format. The following joint models are
 implemented.
  * Revolute X, Y, Z (optimized) and unaligned with Cartesian directions
  * Prismatic X, Y, Z
  * Sperical (quaternion representation)
  * Free (i.e. no constraint, for mobile robots like humanoids -- using
    quaternion representation for the rotation)
 .
